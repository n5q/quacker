% The design document should include (a) a general overview of your system with a small user guide, (b) a detailed design of your software with a focus on the components required to deliver the major functions of your application, (c) your testing strategy, and (d) your group work break-down strategy. The general overview of the system gives a high-level introduction and may include a diagram showing the flow of data between different components; this can be useful for both users and developers of your application. The detailed design of your software should describe the responsibility and interface of each primary function or class (not secondary utility functions/classes) and the structure and relationships among them. Depending on the programming language being used, you may have methods, functions, or classes. The testing strategy discusses your general strategy for testing, with the scenarios being tested, the coverage of your test cases, and (if applicable) some statistics on the number of bugs found and the nature of those bugs. The group work strategy must list the breakdown of the work items among partners, both the time spent (an estimate) and the progress made by each partner, and your method of coordination to keep the project on track. The design document should also include documentation of any decision you have made that is not in the project specification or any coding you have done beyond or different from what is required.

\section{Overview and User Guide}
  \subsection*{Running the Application}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Compile the Application:} \\
		Use the provided \texttt{Makefile} to compile the code by running:
		\begin{verbatim}
		make
		\end{verbatim}
		\item \textbf{Start the Application:} \\
		Execute the application with a database filename:
		\begin{verbatim}
		build/quacker <database_filename>
		\end{verbatim}
		\textit{Example:}
		\begin{verbatim}
		build/quacker test/test.db
		\end{verbatim}
		\item \textbf{Interacting with the Application:} \\
		Upon launch, the application displays the main start page, providing options for interacting with Quacker .
	\end{enumerate}

Quacker can be seperated into three essential components...

\section{Testing Strategy}
In testing this program the Python script \textit{populate\_db.py} was used repopulate the testing database with 
new unqiue data improving the manually typed tests ran on the project and increasing the number of tested edge 
cases. To generate simply run:
\begin{verbatim}
	python3 test/populate_db.py
\end{verbatim}
The script should then return the data of a randomly generated user. This is to make it easier to locate a valid
login to use when entering the program. Example: 
\begin{verbatim}
	Random User Data:
	User ID: 53
	Name: Deborah Scott
	Email: jasminchang@example.com
	Phone: 4567624481
	Password: E1AjR1ib*t
	SUCCESS! Database populated with random test data.
\end{verbatim}
The test script also allows you to easily change parameters regarding the generated data. These can be located in the
defintion of \textit{populate\_db()} and are self-explanitory as seen below:
\begin{lstlisting}
def populate_db(db_name, user_count=100, tweet_count=500, list_count=200, follow_count=300):
\end{lstlisting}
When it came to testing the application, this was done manually due to the page centric format of our user interface. 
The felxibilty of testing manually allowed our team to catch unique edge cases that may have passed over an automated
system.

We give all credit to Allah SWT, all success comes from Him alone.
