Quacker ðŸ¦† is a CLI based social media platform that allows users to share posts, follow others, and interact with content, entirely built with C++ and its corresponding SQLite3 library. 

---

### **Code Execution Guide**
1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - g++: Ensure the GNU C++ compiler is installed and supports C++17.
   - make: Ensure the make utility is available.
   - libsqlite3: Ensure SQLite3 development headers and libraries are installed on the system

2. **Execution**:  
   - Compile the application using the provided `Makefile`:
     ```
     make
     ```
   - Execute the application with a database filename:
     ```
     build/quacker <database_filename>
     ```

3. **Testing**:  
   - Run the test script `test/populate_db.py` to populate the database with random test data:
     ```
     python3 test/populate_db.py
     ```
   - Adjust parameters for the generated data in the `populate_db()` function in the script if needed.

### **Group Work Break-Down Strategy**
We divided tasks based on strengths and collaboration needs:

- **Nasif Qadri**: Responsible for backend development, including database design and implementation of the `Pond` class.
- **Yousef Moussa**: Focused on frontend development and the user interface within the `Quacker` class.
- **Omar Mahmoud**: Managed testing strategies, the data population script, debugging edge cases, and documenting/commenting code.

However, all of us contributed to different parts of the project, so these roles were not strictly defined.

---

### **Collaboration Statement**
We collaborated exclusively within our group. No external collaboration was involved.
